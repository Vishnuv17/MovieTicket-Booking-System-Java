# MovieTicket-Booking-System-Java


The Movie Ticket Booking System is a Java Swing-based desktop application that allows users to book movie tickets with ease. It provides an interactive graphical interface where users can select a movie from a list of available options with visual posters. After choosing a movie, users are taken to a seat selection panel where they can pick their preferred seats from a grid layout. Once seats are selected, users proceed to a payment screen displaying their movie choice and selected seats. The system then confirms the booking with a success message and returns to the home screen for new bookings

Technologies Used: The project uses Java with Swing and AWT for building the graphical interface. Components like JFrame, JPanel, JButton, and CardLayout are used for screen navigation and user interaction
